## Assignment 1: ResNet-18 on CIFAR10
> The task is to take the structure of ResNet-18 model, and train it from scratch on CIFAR10 data, but take very few samples per class. After training, check the test performance. Check the magnitudes of the weights, visualize the kernels at different layers.

## Assignment 2: ViT (B-12) on EuroSAT
> The task is to use a pre-trained ViT like B-12, and prepare the following four models. Then visualize and compare the intermediate feature responses of all the four models using train/test split of the [EuroSAT](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/eurosat) dataset.
> 1. Fine tuning the final layer 
> 2. Fine tuning the bottom layers 
> 3. Full fine tune on the eurosat data 
> 4. No fine tuning
